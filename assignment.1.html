   <h2> How does this game work and how is it played? </h2>
   <p> Geomatry dash is a game about precision and timing. 
    The concept of the game is to beat levels, and the more you progress, the harder the levels become. 
    The game has been out for years, and it is still decently popular. The game is based on one button; that's it. 
    only one button, but don't let that foul you because although the game has the minimum amount of controles a game can have, it is still considered one of the hardest.</p>
   <p style="font-size 40px;"> Main points of the game: </p>
   <ul>
    <li> There is only one button </li>
    <li> Avoid any walls and/or spikes </li>
    <li> You only have one life </li>
    <li> The higher the level, the harder the game becomes </li>
    <li> There is a practice mode to practice your skills </li>
   </ul>
   <p style="font-size 40px;"> You can also choose between a variety of different game modes by clicking the button with a hammer and a wrench on the far right of the menu: </p>

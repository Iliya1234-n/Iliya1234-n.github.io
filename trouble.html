    <h1>🐸 Frogs of the Rainforest</h1>
    <h2> Iliya</h2> <!-- added closing h2 tag so Iliya shows as its own heading and looks correct on the page -->
    <div> <!-- changed from a closing div to an opening div so the stuff below shows on the website -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Meet the Frogs</h2> <!-- fixed closing tag so heading shows right and spacing looks better -->
      <p>Frogs are incredible amphibians that live on every continent except Antarctica. Their
      smooth, moist skin helps them breathe through it.</p>
    </div>
    <div floss="panel"> <!-- changed to class="panel" so CSS styles work and this section looks like the others -->
      <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
      <p>Frogs begin life as eggs in water, hatch into tadpoles, and grow legs as they transform
      into adult frogs. This is called metamorphosis.</p>
      <div id="pond">
        <p>Here’s a “pond” — the parent container.</p>
        <div id="tadpole">
          <p>I'm positioned <strong>absolutely</strong> within my parent!</p> <!-- fixed strong tag so absolutely is bold and stands out -->
        </div>

          <h2>Behavior</h2> <!-- changed h3 to h2 so heading looks like the other sections and spacing is correct -->
          <p>Many frogs are nocturnal. They use sticky tongues to catch insects and call loudly to
          attract mates.</p>
          <div id="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some frogs can leap more than 20 times their body length!</p> <!-- fixed strong tag so Fun Fact is bold and easy to see -->
          </div>
          <div> <!-- changed from a closing div to an opening div so the bottom section shows on the website -->
